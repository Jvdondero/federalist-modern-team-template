## VOICE OF THE EMPLOYEE: New Employee Onboarding

### The Challenge

Early in 2015, the Office of Customer Experience partnered with GSA's Office of Human Resources to get a better understanding of the current employee onboarding process. In doing so, we set out to identify opportunities for improvement, reveal potential integration points with key stakeholders, and increase transparency for new hires.

### What We Did

In order to get an end-to-end picture of the current onboarding experience, we created a series of journey maps based on feedback from recent hires. A journey map takes in a bunch of user data (in this case, satisfaction levels at eight different stages of the onboarding process) and turns it into a generalized emotional curve. What this allows us to do is identify low points or inflections in that curve as key areas for improvement. In this case, our customer data came from a series of sessions…

### What We Learned

Overall, we found that inconsistencies, delays, and a lack of transparency in the onboarding process are resulting in negative experiences that impact new employees’ ability to effectively transition into their new positions. In particular, we focused in on three moments in the onboarding journey: the offer process, the security process, and the waiting period.

### Recommendations

Focusing on these key moments, we came up with a few recommendations for improving the employee onboarding experience in the near term. We suggested...

* Incorporating a description of the security process into the onboarding conversation to set clear expectations

* Dedicating a backup point of contact for hiring manager because we heard from many employees that their point of contact was out of the office and unaccessible

* Creating a system for delivering on boarding info to new employees as it is relevant over the first 45 days to avoid overwhelming people when they start

In addition to suggesting these specific improvements, we developed eight different surveys for new employees so we can continue gathering data that will drive future refinements to the onboarding process. These surveys are delivered to new employees at 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, 180 days, 1 year, 1.5 years, and 2 years after starting, then also upon exit. An important recommendation for these surveys is that the questions are updated on an ongoing basis to ensure we are getting feedback that is relevant and actionable.

### Outcomes

The new employee surveys are already delivering valuable data on the onboarding process through identifying various training opportunities new employees would appreciate.

Onboarding new employees is a shared responsibility - as supervisors, you play an important role in implementing these changes. Keep an eye out for new surveys, added messaging, and process enhancements, and let us know what is working well and what could be improved upon.
